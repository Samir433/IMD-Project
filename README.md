## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

-   **Node.js**: (v16 or higher recommended) - [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   **Python**: (v3.8 or higher) - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
-   **pip**: Python package installer - [pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

---

### Backend Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/solar-radiation-prediction.git](https://github.com/yourusername/solar-radiation-prediction.git)
    cd solar-radiation-prediction/backend
    ```
2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

    **On macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    **On Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install backend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Run the FastAPI server:**
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

---

### Frontend Setup

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173` (or as indicated in your terminal).

---

## Usage

1.  Open your web browser and navigate to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
2.  Input meteorological parameters such as **temperature**, **humidity**, **wind speed**, and **cloud cover** into the provided form.
3.  Submit the form to receive instant solar radiation predictions.
4.  Explore the **correlation analysis graphs** and **trend visualizations** to gain deeper insights into the data.
5.  Utilize the export functionality to download prediction results and trend graphs for further offline analysis.
6.  **(For Data Scientists)** Access dedicated UI sections or interact directly with the API to configure model parameters and initiate new training sessions.
